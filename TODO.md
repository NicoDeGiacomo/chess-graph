# TODO

## Fixes

- ~~The white piece icon and the black piece icon look completely different. I like the white one.~~ Done
- ~~Cant move the pieces by two clicks, only by drag.~~ Done
- ~~The first node after the root does not appear exactly on the same y position, its a tiny bit below and it is noticeable in the arrow.~~ Done
- New Repertoire button should be New Graph 
- My Repertoires button should be My Graphs
- The default first graph should be named "My Initial Graph"
- Since the users can use a graph for one single opening or multiple openings, we will use "graphs" when we talk.

## Nice To Have

- More optional views: top-down, floating window
- Dark/light themes
- CI / CD
- Groupings (folders) of graphs
- Buttons at the side of the board with: open in chess.com, open in lichess, etc.
- Convert the repertoire on my main obsidian as an example graph to show the users.
- Arrows should move the game forwards and backwards
- There is a "toogle" interactivity button on the graph canvas, it should be locked by default (interactivity disabled)
- Ability to draw arrows and paint squares of different colors on the board. And that they are saved with the position for that node.
- Using an alert for "Delete "My Repertoire"?" is ugly
