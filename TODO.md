# TODO

## High Priority

- ... 

## Medium Priority

- Ability to draw arrows and paint squares of different colors on the board, saved per node
- When I drag a node, it goes back to its orginal position if i select another node.

## Low Priority

- CI / CD
- Groupings (folders) of graphs
- More optional views: top-down, floating window
- Dark/light themes
- Convert the repertoire on my main obsidian as an example graph to show the users. Use the full lenght of the features (tags, colors, branches, transpositions, etc)
- If I click on the transpositions information it should take me to the respective node.
- All normal arrows are squared but transpositions are circled.

## Accessibility

## New Features

- v2: login

## Done

## Improvements
- Are we using too much storage? Should we implement a compression strategy to save the graphs on the browser?
- Flip board option that gets saved to the entire graph, so it always renders the same.

## Security
- Should we make sure editing the json of the graph is not possible / detect when it was tampered? Is that a security risk?
