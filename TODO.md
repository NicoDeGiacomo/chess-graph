## Nice To Have

- More optional views: top-down, floating window
- Dark/light themes
- CI / CD
- Groupings (folders) of graphs
- Buttons at the side of the board with: open in chess.com, open in lichess, etc.
- Convert the repertoire on my main obsidian as an example graph to show the users.
- Arrows should move the game forwards and backwards
- There is a "toogle" interactivity button on the graph canvas, it should be locked by default (interactivity disabled)
- Ability to draw arrows and paint squares of different colors on the board. And that they are saved with the position for that node.
- Using an alert for "Delete "My Repertoire"?" is ugly
- "Clear Graph" button with a confirmation modal.
- We should detect transpositions and join the nodes in the graph
