# TODO

## Fixes

- The white piece icon and the black piece icon look completely different. I like the white one.

## To Do

- Landing page with features, about, etc.
- SEO

## New Features

- v2: login

## Warnings

- Vite build warns about chunk size >500 kB (`index-BzW9hk47.js` is ~737 kB). Consider code-splitting or `manualChunks`.

## Nice To Have

- More optional views: top-down, floating window
- Dark/light themes
- CI / CD
- Groupings (folders) of graphs
- Footer with information and important links
- Buttons at the side of the board with: open in chess.com, open in lichess, etc.
- Convert the repertoire on my main obsidian as an example graph to show the users.
- Arrows should move the game forwards and backwards
