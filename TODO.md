## Medium Priority


## Low Priority

- ~~Groupings (folders) of graphs~~ Done
- More optional views: top-down, floating window

## Accessibility

- ...

## New Features

- v2: login

## Improvements

- Are we using too much storage? Should we implement a compression strategy to save the graphs on the browser?

## Security

- Should we make sure editing the json of the graph is not possible / detect when it was tampered? Is that a security risk?
- Should we save a file different that .json? To hide a bit the functionality to avoid tampering. Should/can we use a custom .chessgraph for example? Can/should it be a binary or something else?

## Non Code 
- Check all features are documented to the user in some page.
- Re-Run a SEO skill check
- Reddit, Threads, Twitter, Chess.com, Lichess, Chess Forums, Product Hunt, etc, posts.
