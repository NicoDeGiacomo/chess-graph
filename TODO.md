## Medium Priority


## Low Priority

- Groupings (folders) of graphs
- More optional views: top-down, floating window
- Dark/light themes
- Convert the repertoire on my main obsidian as an example graph to show the users. Use the full lenght of the features (tags, colors, branches, transpositions, etc)

## Improvements
- Are we using too much storage? Should we implement a compression strategy to save the graphs on the browser?

## Security
- Should we make sure editing the json of the graph is not possible / detect when it was tampered? Is that a security risk?
